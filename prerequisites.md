### Before you start
* PRACTICE! Don't just read the commands. Type them into the terminal yourself. Experiment!
* Create some dummy files that will make experimentation easy. Use them with the examples below. Expand on them.

## GAWK is the coolest one apparently!

* Make sure you have 'gawk' installed. 
* It has more features than the usual default 'mawk'. 
* You can see what implementation of awk you're using 
* by typing `man awk` and looking at the header.
* If you have 'mawk' just install awk with `sudo apt-get install gawk`
